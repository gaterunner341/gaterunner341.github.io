## [WiFi Harvester](./wifiHarvester.md)

WiFi Harvester is a Python script I developed as a forensics tool during my [Python Forensics course](https://classlist.champlain.edu/show/course/number/FOR_360){:target="_blank"} at Champlain College.

## [PCAPa](./PCAPa.md)

I wrote PCAP analyzer, a BASH-based script, while I was developing my BASH skills. PCAPa can be used to analyze PCAP network packet captures files. This is an adapted script based on a video tutorial from [Packet Pioneer](https://packetpioneer.com/about-me/){:target="_blank"}.
