GoogleFi sent out an email on 30 Jan 2023, informing its users of suspicious activity on the network of a "primary network provider."

The system in question, a 3rd party used for "GoogleFi customer support purposes" contains limited customer data including the following:

- Phone number
- When accounts were activated
- Data about a user's mobile service plan
- SIM card serial number
- Account status, active or inactive

GoogleFi stated the potentially limited data breach does not include information such as name, date of birth, email addresses, and payment card information.

While the email does not include the name of the 3rd party, the site [9too5Google.com](https://9to5google.com/2023/01/30/google-fi-data-breach-tmobile/){: .hover-underline-animation target="_blank"} suspects the 3rd party could be T-mobile, which recently release news of their own [data breach](https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/19/t-mobile-data-breach-customer-info/){: .hover-underline-animation target="_blank"}.

## What does this mean for me, as a user?
If you are GoogleFi user, while at this point there is no reason to believe other information about your has been copied. For the most part, this breach could potentially just lead to more SMSishing attacks (a form of phishing using text messages) since subscriber phone number was included in the breach. As always, users should be cautious when clicking on links from unknown numbers.

Other general security steps a users can take include:
- Enabling 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) on Google accounts
- Adding a recovery email and phone number to GoogleFi accounts
- Ensure strong passwords are used for their account
