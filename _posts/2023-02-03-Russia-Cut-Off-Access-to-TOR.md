Last month, Russia cut off access to TOR services and servers according to several reports from media including **[Reuters]( https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-ratchets-up-internet-crackdown-with-block-privacy-service-tor-2021-12-08/){: .hover-underline-animation target=”_blank”}** and **[Forbs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2021/12/09/russia-doubles-down-on-censorship-with-expanded-block-on-tor/?sh=538e9a3319bc){: .hover-underline-animation target=”_blank”}**.

TOR, also known as the Onion Router Project, is an anonymizing network used by malicious actors and those seeking privacy for their personal activities or professional work such as journalist working in restrictive countries.

According to the reports, shutting off TOR access is part of a larger effort by the Russian government cracking down on foreign technology companies, and restriction access to virtual private network (VPN) tools and services.

TOR Project says Russian users account for 14% of their daily active users, second only to the United States.

Roskomnadzor, which is the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media in Russia made the announcement, declaring TOR was being used to "access unlawful content." This kind of restriction is expected from Russia, all while the country ignores or encourages cyber-attacks, even though TOR, on other nation-states or other victims which advance Russian priorities and objectives.

TOR Project published a Russian-language **[guide](https://forum.torproject.net/t/tor-blocked-in-russia-how-to-circumvent-censorship/982){: .hover-underline-animation target=”_blank”}** on how to use TOR bridges which have not been blocked as a result of the clampdown.
