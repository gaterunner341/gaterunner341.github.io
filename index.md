## Welcome to PhillipKittelson.com!

I'm Phillip, a professional with experience across many disciplines of security. This is my personal blog, which I use to "learn out loud" and bring you my opinion on all the things security. You can learn more about me [here](./about-Phillip.md){: .hover-underline-animation}.

In the mean time, click around, and check out my blog posts, projects I'm working on, and publications I have put out.

## Projects
Check out my projects page to see what I'm working on.

## Publications
While the only publications I have taken part in are academic, I plan to work my way into publishing for a wider audience.

## Blog
You'll find blog posts about security here, more often cybersecurity which is my current speciality.
